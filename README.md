1.      We do BDD in our environment. We would like to see how you solve the problem using BDD/TDD. Incase if you are not familiar/comfortable with BDD/TDD, we are ok with plain old unit tests. Unit tests are mandatory.

2.      Consider​ ​complexity.​ ​How​ ​fast​ ​does​ ​your​ ​code​ ​run?​ ​How​ ​does​ ​it​ ​scale?

3.      ​Consider​ ​cases​ ​where​ ​we​ ​want​ ​​N​ ​primes.

4.      ​Do​ ​not​ ​use​ ​the​ ​Prime​ ​class​ ​from​ ​stdlib​ ​(write​ ​your​ ​own​ ​code).
